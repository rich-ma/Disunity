Fake Jim: You seriously never noticed? Hey, hats off to you for not seeing race. 
Dwight: Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday? 
Fake Jim: Uh, Wellington systems? Sold them 10 cases of 24-pound letter stock. Or, were you talking about Krieger-Murphy? Because I didn't close that one yet, but I'm hoping I've got a voicemail from Paul Krieger waiting for me.
