Professor Oak: The early bird gets the worm, or in this case, uhh, the Pokemon.
Ash: Does that mean all the Pokemon are gone?
Professor Oak: Well, there is still one left, but I --
Ash: Professor I'll take it!!
Professor Oak: I think I should warn you -- There is a problem with this last one.
Ash: I have to have a Pokemon
Professor Oak: Well, in that case...
Pikachu: Pikachu.
Professor Oak: It's name is Pikachu.
Ash: Oh, it's so cute, it's the best of all!
Professor Oak: You'll see.
Ash: Oh, hi Pikachu.
Pikachu: Pika...
Professor Oak: It's also known as an Electric mouse -- It's usually shy, but can sometimes have an electrifying personality.
Ash: I see what you mean.
Professor Oak: Shocking, isn't it? Now take these -- your Pokedex and Pokeballs.
Ash: Thank... YOUUUUU!!!!!
Ash: https://pa1.narvii.com/6387/44e403516c02a89e4b9cfef548076f85de095ee4_hq.gif
Professor Oak: YOUR WELCOME!!!!
Ash: Mom!
Delia: Oh, Ash I'm so proud of you. You're finally gonna fulfill your dream and it starts with your Pokemon training. But I'm -- I'm gonna miss you so much. Oh, my little boy. I packed your sneakers and jeans, nice clean shirts and underwear, and your favorite snacks and some hot chocolate in case you want something hot. But be careful not to burn yourself. And an pair of rubber gloves to do your laundry, and a new clothesline to hang it out to dry --
Ash: Mom, you're embarrassing me! In front of all these people -- don't you know I'm a big kid, now? Pokemon trainers can take care of themselves.
Delia: I understand. Hmm? That's your Pokemon?
Pikachu: Pikachu.

Ash: Yep, that's my Pokemon.
Pikachu: Pi.
Ash: Uhh... With Pikachu at my side, I'll get all the Pokemon in the world.
Delia: I thought all Pokemon stayed inside their Pokeballs. Why doesn't this one?
Ash: Uh.. Oh, yeah, that's right. Pikachu, get in the ball now.
Pikachu: Pi-ka-chu-pi-ka-chu-pi-ka-chu
Delia: Oh, you're playing catch; you're friends already.
Ash: Uh, sure. Pikachu and I are real pals, right?
Delia: But it's a little weird.
Ash: Weird?
Professor Oak: Those rubber gloves your mom packed will come in handy.
Ash: Why?
Professor Oak: Rubber blocks electricity.
Ash: Great!!!!!!
